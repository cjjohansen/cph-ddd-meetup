# cph-ddd-meetup Strategic Domain Driven Exercises

## Tasks to be done

1.1 Convert one of [Oskar Dudycz examples](https://github.com/oskardudycz/EventSourcing.NetCore) to our simple logistics domain. Take inspiration from domain events identified in [solution document](./logistics%20cata/Documentation/workshop%20solution.md)
1.2 Implement a saga for a money transfer building upon [Decider Pattern for implementation](https://gist.github.com/akhansari/)

1.3 Convert [Decider Pattern for implementation](https://gist.github.com/akhansari/) to our logistics domain.

1.4 Walk through the [current workshop](./Documentation/workshop.md) and [solution documents](./Documentation/workshop%20solution.md) and give feed back. How much can we accomplish in one workshop. IS the structure good? Will people benefit / understand. Do we put emphasis on the right things?

1.5 Define acceptance criteria for workshop 1
1.6. Define list of workshops
1.7. Pick a collaboration Technique and be the driver for designing a workshop covering that technique.



## Background and Ambition

In the Copenhagen DDD Meetup group we want to focus on what we call "Strategic Domain Driven Excercises".

We want to prepare a good collaborative hands on exercises where collaboration techniquies popular in domain driven design will be practiced.

These techniques could be one of:

- Event storming
- Event modelleing
- Domain Story Telling
- Example mapping
- Wardley mapping 
- Impact mapping
- Business model canvas
- Context mapping
- Bounded Context canvas
- Data Product Canvas


## Inspiration

We have chosen to take experience from

[Transport tycoon kata: ](https://github.com/trustbit/exercises/blob/master/transport-tycoon-1.md) 

### From Design to Code

A question that many will ask is how to get from collaboration output to code!?

We would like to address this problem as well.

There are many options. Currently we feel that an implementation focusing on Events, Event sourcing and perhaps a more functional approach coud be good for many to learn. 


The material from   Oskar Dudycz is pretty neat. So a we will take inspiration from his [github repo](https://github.com/oskardudycz/EventSourcing.NetCore)


One idea is also to try to use the Decider pattern:

[Decider Pattern for implementation:](https://gist.github.com/akhansari/c2d57470d10aacd04aae71258c52bfc1)

Also using event sourcing would be nice to demonstrate, so here is a video telling about implementation eith Marten.
